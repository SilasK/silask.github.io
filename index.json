This sequencing technology enables researchers to gain insight into the composition and functional potential of a microbial community in situ. Even though it is called metagenomics, the sequenced reads were not analyzed on a genome level due to technical limitations, especially the lack of reference genomes for many microbiomes.\nIn 2017, Parks et al. published nearly 8,000 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), which substantially expanded the tree of life (Parks et al. 2017). Since then, we have entered an era of large-scale (re-)assembly in metagenomics. Many researchers started to assemble MAGs from various metagenomes, often recovering dozens of new species. 2017 also marks the year of the beginning of my PhD. So I had the opportunity to do my PhD during this exciting time. I worked mainly on a pipline that allows producing such MAG catalogs with only three commands. We applied our pipeline to all the samples from the mouse genome in order to recover a comprehensive catalog of genomes for this microbiome.\nWith this study now published, I reflect on what can be improved for the benefit of others that take the challenge to create comprehensive catalogs for their microbiome of interest.\n1. Use co-binning Most studies use single-sample assembly and binning because it allows the processing of each sample in parallel, making the approach very scalable. The downside of this approach is that the coverage information from only one sample is used. But using the differenctial coverage from multiple samples can be very useful for binning. There are alternatives, co-assembly, and cross-mapping, which allow for the use of differential abundance, but they have their problems and challenges 1.\nRecently, a new strategy for binning was developed, which I call Co-Binning2. The method works as follows:\nAssemble each sample separately Concatenate the assembly of all samples to one Map the reads from all samples to the concatenated assembly Bin the contigs from each sample separately, but use the differential abundance from all samples. This strategy more or less combines the advantages of the other binning strategy. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t require co-assembly and allows for the use of differential abundance and scales to many samples (~100). This strategy is implemented in the two tools Vamb and SemiBin. The authors of Vamb also claim that it can disentangle genomes from different subspecies up to 97% ANI, which I find pretty interesting. SemiBin uses not only the abundance but also the taxonomic annotation. Both binners could, in theory, also be used for Eukaryote binning. The only adaptation to SemiBin would be to use a taxonomic annotation that includes Eukaryotes.\nSo, If you plan to recover many genomes from metagenomes, think about trying out these new binners. I already implemented both binners in metagenome-atlas.\n2. Optimize quality estimation The second step comes after realizing that the MAGs are not as good as we think \u0026ndash; even the \u0026lsquo;high-quality\u0026rsquo;. The part has to do with the fact that MAGs are just of lousy quality due to limitations of the computational pipelines. Manual curation is needed (Chen et al. 2020). But part has to do with the quality estimators telling us they are of good quality when reality, they are not.\nUse up-to-date databases for genome evaluation The whole field uses checkM, which is an elegant tool. However, its database was not updated since 2015! Everybody is waiting for version 2 of the tool, but in the meantime, one can use BUSCO which works similarly, is based on the up-to-date OrthoDB markers, and works for eukaryotes.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t automatically select marker-gene CheckM and BUSCO automatically select the most appropriate marker gene set for evaluation, which is very handy, but it might also bias the results. For example, a genome is incomplete. Its taxonomic lineage cannot be determined, which causes it to be evaluated at the most basic level. If by chance, it contains many of the basic marker genes, which often cluster together in operons, it\u0026rsquo;s estimated as highly complete.\nIf the genome in question is from a completely new species, there is no way to circumvent this, and it\u0026rsquo;s good that the more unknown genomes are evaluated at more basic levels. However, if the genome belongs to an abundant species, you likely have hundreds of other genomes from the same species (in a radius of 95% ANI). In the worst case, a bad genome evaluated at the most basic level could be estimated to have better quality than other genomes evaluated with the more extended marker gene sets.\nIf you have multiple genomes of the same species, which you have if you create a genome collection, you want them to be all evaluated with the same marker gene set. Together with Matija Trikovic, we made a snakemake pipeline that does exactly this.\nWe re-analyzed genomes from the UHGG and HumGut databases with BUSCO and the same set for each genome. What was estimated by CheckM to be 99% complete came out to less than 50% for some genomes! Which is due to both effects. 1. BUSCO has a more up-to-date database, and 2. We evaluated genomes from the same species cluster not automatically but with the same marker genes as the representative.\nCompleteness estimatd for all MAGs in the HumGut catalog. The x-axis shows the completeness estimated with CheckM in auto-lineage mode. The y-axis shows the Completeness estimated using BUSCO with the same marker genes for each species. Ad-hoc quality estimation This point is more an idea than concrete advice. If you have many genomes from the same species (or higher taxonomic clade) from a specific environment, then per definition, you would have the best collection of genomes to evaluate the completeness. You could define an ad-hoc set of marker genes, e.g., genes at 95% identity present in \u0026gt;90% of the genomes. Then you turn it around and ask how many genomes have \u0026gt;90% of these genes. It helps to refine completeness for a given species.\n2. Filter chimeric genomes The ad-hoc quality estimation doesn\u0026rsquo;t help with contamination. But recently, new tools came out that check if genomes are chimeric â€” for example, GUNC or Charcoal. Taxonomically annotating contigs allows identifying contigs with incongruent taxonomy, aka chimera. This strategy is reference-based, but it provides filtering with a much broader scope than only looking at the marker genes.\nFinally, with more and more genome catalogs out there, I think the question becomes more crucial about efficiently using them. We choose 1 genome per species as a reference, which we use to map reads against it or build a Kraken DB. This approach glosses over much of the strain variation already contained in the genome collections. In some publications, the authors make Kraken DBS with many genomes per species, which increases the mapping rate overall, but when estimated on the species level, it\u0026rsquo;s lower (Nasko et al. 2018).\nI could write more, but I leave it there for my first blog on metagenomics.

Accordingly, the similarity between human and mouse microbiomes at a low taxonomic level is not clear. We construct a comprehensive mouse microbiota genome (CMMG) catalog by assembling all currently available mouse gut metagenomes and combining them with published refer- ence and metagenome-assembled genomes. The 41â€™798 genomes cluster into 1â€™573 spe- cies, of which 78.1% are uncultured, and we discovered 226 new genera, seven new families, and one new order. CMMG enables an unprecedented coverage of the mouse gut microbiome exceeding 86%, increases the mapping rate over four-fold, and allows func- tional microbiota analyses of human and mouse linking them to the driver species. Compar- ing CMMG to microbiota from the unified human gastrointestinal genomes shows an overlap of 62% at the genus but only 10% at the species level, demonstrating that human and mouse gut microbiota are largely distinct. CMMG contains the most comprehensive col- lection of consistently functionally annotated species of the mouse and human microbiome to date, setting the ground for analysis of new and reanalysis of existing datasets at an unprecedented depth.","tags":["Metagenome-assembled genomes","Genome-resolved metagenomics","Metagenomics","Binning","metagenome-atlas","Virus"],"title":"Comprehensive mouse microbiota genome catalog reveals major difference to its human counterpart","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silas Kieser"],"categories":[],"content":"Disclaimer: Ich bin keinImmunologe, aber ich fand es wichtig meine Meinung gut erklÃ¤rt fÃ¼r Verwante und Freunde aufzuschreiben\nÃœber-rasch-end schnelle Impfstoff-Entwicklung Die Geschwindigkeit der Entwicklung der Corona Impfung war fÃ¼r manche eine Ãœber-rasch-ung. Was sonst Jahre dauerte war in einigen Monaten mÃ¶glich1. Es gibt viele Faktoren, die dazu beigetragen haben, dass es mÃ¶glich war, die Impfstoffe so schnell zu entwickeln und zu testen. Vor allem das grosse Interesse, beispielslose wissenschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und natÃ¼rlich Geld. Mehr Information hier.\nManche kÃ¶nnen das GefÃ¼hl trozdem nicht loswerden, dass das doch etwas zu schnell ging. Warum sonst wird ein jetzt Booster benÃ¶tigt?\nWarum eine zweite Dosis? LangjÃ¤hrige Erfahrung mit Impfungen und immunologischer Forschung, zeigt folgendes:\nEine erste Impfdosis, bewirkt nach einigen Tagen oder Wochen eine Immun-Antwort. Immunzellen, die den AntikÃ¶rper neutralisieren kÃ¶nnen werden zur Multiplikation angeredet und produzieren AntikÃ¶rper. Nach dem die Schein-infektion vorÃ¼ber ist, reduziert sich die Zahl der pathogen-spezifischen Immunzellen wieder auf ein normales Niveau. Diese so genannten Memory-Zellen, halten wache, damit das Immunsystem schneller reagieren kann, sollte man irgendwo im KÃ¶rper wieder einen AntikÃ¶rper von dem geimpften Pathogen finden oder einer dem ihn Ã¤hnelt.\nWenn man jetzt nie wieder einen Ã¤hnlichen pathogene trifft, nimmt die Zahl der Memory-Zellen langsam ab. AntikÃ¶rper werden keine mehr gebildet. Warum auch sollte man das Leben lang Wache schieben gegen einen Pathogen der nie kommt.\nEine Zweite Dosis, bewirkt jetzt, dass diese wachenden Immun-Zellen wieder aktiviert werden. Die Immunantwort ist schneller, stÃ¤rker und das gebildete Memory hÃ¤lt lÃ¤nger. Darum ist eine zweite Dosis fÃ¼r fast alle Impfungen empfolen. Irgendwie logisch, dass der KÃ¶rper nicht allzeit bereit ist, gegen Pathogene zu reagieren, die alle zehn Jahre auftauchen, wenn Ã¼berhaupt. Aber Immun-Zellen halten wache fÃ¼r hÃ¤ufige pathogene.\nDer Booster, der keiner ist Weil die WÃ¤chter-zellen halt auch absterben, werden fÃ¼r die meisten Impfungen Auffrischungsimpfungen vorgeschlagen, z.B. Tetanus alle 10 Jahren. 10 Jahren! Warum mÃ¼ssen wir dann gegen Covid schon nach 6 Monaten wieder Impfen? MÃ¼ssen wir uns jetzt einfach jedes Jahr wieder impfen lassen?\nVorab, es ist nicht blindes drauflos impfen. Die Aufforderung zur Booster Impfung is auf Studien belegt, die zeigen, dass ca. 6 Monaten nach der Covid-impfung die AntikÃ¶rper abnehmen. Und anderen Studien, die zeigen, dass die Booster den Schutz erneuert.\nSo wie es aussieht ist der Abstand, zwischen 1. \u0026amp; 2. Dosis der Corona Impfstoffe etwas kurz gewÃ¤hlt worden. Denn es braucht etwas Zeit, bis die Immunantwort vorÃ¼ber ist und sich Memory Zellen gebildet haben, die dann reaktiviert werden mit der Zweiten Dosis. Anders gesagt, die ersten Zwei dosen funktionieren wie eine. Und der Booster ist eigentlich keiner, sondern nur die Â«Zweite DosisÂ». Da eine richtige zweite Dosis hilft die Immunantwort, schneller, robuster, und prÃ¤ziser zu machen, macht es fÃ¼r mich Sinn den Booster zu nehmen, was ich heute tat. Da die ersten zwei dosen eigentlich nur wie eine wirken, macht es fÃ¼r mich sinn nur zweimal immunisierte als vollstÃ¤ndig immunisiert zu betrachten2. Es ist auch logisch die Zeitspanne bis zum Booster nicht zu gross zu lassen. Wie bereits erwÃ¤hnt, die Wirkung ist auch mit Studien belegt.\nIch bin Ã¼berzeugt, dass die Impfung nicht nur einem selbst schÃ¼tzt, sondern auch beitrÃ¤gt den NÃ¤chsten zu schÃ¼tzen, auch wenn nicht 100%. Aber ich werde wahrscheinlich einen anderen Blog darÃ¼ber schreiben.\nWarum, ist der Abstand zwischen den ersten beiden Dosen zu kurz. Ehrlich gesagt ich weiss es nicht. Wahrscheinlich haben mehrere Faktoren eine Rolle gespielt. Vor allem, dass die Impfung schnell getestet und zugelassen werden kann. Vielleicht auch, dass einen hohen Schutz schnell erreicht wird. NatÃ¼rlich hÃ¤tte man Jahre lang an den Impfstoffen geforscht, hÃ¤tte man alle mÃ¶glichen ZeitabstÃ¤nde testen kÃ¶nnen. So gesehen ist die Impfentwicklung vielleicht etwas Ã¼bereilt gewesen. Aber, anders rum hÃ¤tte man 6 Monate gewartet, wÃ¤ren die Impfungen 6 Monate spÃ¤ter erhÃ¤ltlich gewesen und viele Menschenleben wÃ¤ren verloren gegangen. Im Nachhinein ist man immer klÃ¼ger. Ich will nicht die Pharma Konzerne verteidigen, aber ich denke finanzielle Interesse sind nicht wirklich relevant gewesen fÃ¼r das Timing der ersten beiden dosen. Die dosen wÃ¤ren so oder so verkauft worden.\nIst die Impfung nicht wirkungslos gegen Omikron? Wir waren als Familie in QuarantÃ¤ne. HÃ¤tten wir Omikron bekommen wÃ¼rde ich keinen Booster machen. Ich denke eine vollstÃ¤ndige Immunisierung ist immer besser als eine halbazige oder gar keine. Wenn man Omikron bekommt, ist es anscheinend weniger schlimm als die Delta-Variante, aber man steck auch mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit Andere an, was ich nicht so gut finde.\nGeboostert und dann? NatÃ¼rlich heisst das nicht das mit dem Booster alles getan ist. Wahrscheinlich werden wir Auffrischungsimpfungen, wie beim Tetanus haben. Wahrscheinlich sind die nÃ¤her beieinander als beim Tetanus, da wir uns in einer Pandemie befinden. Vielleicht gibt es auch jÃ¤hrliche Auffrischungsimpfungen fÃ¼r Personen mit Risiko, Ã¤hnlich wie die Grippe. Aber ich sehe keinen treffenden Grund fÃ¼r alle jÃ¤hrliche Booster zu nehmen.\nWenn man es genau nimmt, kÃ¶nnte man sogar sagen, dass die Entwicklung des RNA-Impfstoff nur 2 Tage gedauert hat, seitdem das erste Genom des Sars-Cov-2 verÃ¶ffentlicht wurde. Der Rest der Zeit war nÃ¶tig fÃ¼r klinische Studien.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nImpfung+ Booster, 2x genesen, oder genesen + geimpft\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":1642179120,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642409520,"objectID":"6efc0dc1e7d7ff8091325a40f55f7cdd","permalink":"https://silask.github.io/post/booster/","publishdate":"2022-01-14T17:52:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/booster/","section":"post","summary":"Die Entwicklung der Corona-Impfung war vielleicht doch etwas zu rasch.

Recent improvements in algorithms enabled the assembly of larger and larger contigs from metagenomes, which then can be clustered together to produce draft genomes of new species. In this way, an almost unimaginable number of genomes from uncultured microbes could be assembled. These genomes allow for dataset-specific taxonomic analysis and genome-resolved functional annotation of metagenomes.\nIn this online course, we will familiarize the participants with the steps required in assembly-based metagenomics (assembly, binning, genome completeness estimation, taxonomic and functional annotation).

Compared with 20 healthy local controls, 71 Bangladeshi children hospitalized with acute diarrhoea (AD) of viral, mixed viral/bacterial, bacterial and unknown aetiology showed a significantly decreased bacterial diversity with loss of pathways characteristic for the healthy distal colon microbiome (mannan degradation, methylerythritol phosphate and thiamin biosynthesis), an increased proportion of faecal streptococci belonging to the Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus salivarius species complexes, and an increased level of E. coli-associated virulence genes. No enteropathogens could be attributed to a subgroup of patients. Elevated lytic coliphage DNA was detected in 2 out of 5 investigated enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC)-infected patients. Streptococcal outgrowth in AD is discussed as a potential nutrient-driven consequence of glucose provided with oral rehydration solution.","tags":["human gut microbiota","metagenomics","NestlÃ©","phages"],"title":"Bangladeshi children with acute diarrhoea show faecal microbiomes with increased Streptococcus abundance, irrespective of diarrhoea aetiology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silas Kieser","Shafiqul A.

The role of the gut microbiome in malnutrition is an active research area. Parenteral antibiotics are recommended by the World Health Organization in hospitalized pediatric patients with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) presenting signs of infections. Stool microbiota data for such patients are, however, lacking. To fill this gap, we studied the stool microbiota in 19 SAM patients from Bangladesh hospitalized with acute diarrhea (AD) and compared it with that of matched 20 healthy control subjects (HC).","tags":["human gut microbiota","metagenomics","NestlÃ©","phages"],"title":"Antibiotic Treatment Leads to Fecal Escherichia coli and Coliphage Expansion in Severely Malnourished Diarrhea Patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1483315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483315200,"objectID":"c48e4d9a6d22d93edd8428a4fad58f99","permalink":"https://silask.github.io/project/apologetics/","publishdate":"2017-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/apologetics/","section":"project","summary":" ","tags":["apologetics"],"title":"Apologetics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"NestlÃ© Research Center Feb 2016 â€“ Feb 2017\nThis Internship allowed me to learn from experts about children gut microbiota.
