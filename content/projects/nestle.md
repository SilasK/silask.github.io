Nestlé Research Center
Feb 2016 – Feb 2017

This Internship allowed me to learn from experts about children gut microbiota. My job was to build a analysis pipeline for metagenomics analysis.  
I'd like to thank especially Bernard Berger, Olga Sakwinska and Harald Brüssow for their supervision.


Achievements:

- Implementation of metagenomics analysis pipeline
- Relating microbiota data to human health
- First publication
