## Quarto

Quarto is kind of the next generation of R-markdown. It uses a lot from the pandoc and other tools. Therefore it can also include python code and even run trough a jupyter interface. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

I tried many other tools to create documents/websites:
- R-markdown
- Manubot
- Latex
- Markdown + pandoc

I think quarto has the most rubust output.
Obviously you can create html documents but also the word output is really good. 
You can specify a template and so create a word document using your companies fonts and formats.

Have you ever tried to put two images side by side in word and add referencable legends to them. In quarto it's really easy + you can link or crate the figures directly in the document. No more copy paste updated versions of images to a working draft. 

I like to use the cite-doi option which is enabled by the lua filter `doi2cite.lua`.

You can simply specify a doi and it will be added to the bibliography and the text [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061217].


**Most important** Markdown text can easily be copy pasted to ChatGPT and improved. No worry about formating issues there.

## Quarto and Hugo

You can render a quarto document to a hugo website. See [this post as an example.](https://github.com/SilasK/silask.github.io/blob/master/content/post/using_quarto/index.qmd)

To include the quarto documents in the continous webside build I added two rules to render all quarto documents in the content folder, before rendereing the webpage with hugo. 

Have a look at my [Github workflow file](https://github.com/SilasK/silask.github.io/blob/81e26b2cf8028fd3dedad9c1cd4bebd09d9bf61a/.github/workflows/deploy_with_hugo.yml#L63C1-L78C29)

That side I will probably not use too much code because in the CI intergration.
