## Try out quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

It is kind of the next generation of R-markdown. But it alows also to run python code in the same document.

For blog I will use mainly the mardon features. But I like to use the cite-doi option which is enabled by the lua script `doi2cite.lua`.

I think it's a really cool ecosystem that allows you to create html, and word documents from the same source.

You can even specify a template and use it to create a word document.

Now I add a citation to a doi [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061217]
