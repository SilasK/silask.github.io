## Try out quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

It is kind of the next generation of R-markdown. But it alows also to run python code in the same document.

For blog I will use mainly the mardon features. But I like to use the cite-doi option which is enabled by the lua script `doi2cite.lua`.

I think it's a really cool ecosystem that allows you to create html, and word documents from the same source.

You can even specify a template and use it to create a word document.

Now I add a citation to a doi [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061217] 




## R code

I will add some R code that should be executed. 
For this to work I needed to install R dependencies in my ci script. 

```
- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2
        with:
          packages:
            any::knitr
            any::rmarkdown
            any::downlit
            any::xml2

```
Info found [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/setup-quarto-on-github-actions-doesnt-seem-to-install-everything-needed/156823/2)

Additional packages I install in the R code chunk.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: false

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/main/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio/lter_penguins.png){style="float:right;" fig-alt="Illustration of three species of Palmer Archipelago penguins: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adelie. Artwork by @allison_horst." width="401"}

The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") package contains size measurements for `r nrow(penguins)` penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths of these penguins.

```{r}
#| label: plot-penguins
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

ggplot(
    penguins,
    aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)
) +
    geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")) +
    labs(
        title = "Flipper and bill length",
        subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
        x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
        color = "Penguin species", shape = "Penguin species"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
```
