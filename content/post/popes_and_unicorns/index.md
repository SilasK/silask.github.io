As an aspiring scientist and christan believer
I always felt there is a conflict between science and religion.
One side is rational the other delisonate, as Richard Dawkins trumpetes it. 
Naturally, I felt the need to defend my self. 

I read a lot about arguments for the existence of god.
How the Big bang begs the question of a transcendental origin.
How renownd scientist reconsile evolution with the bible. etc. 
I prepared for the battle.


Little did I konw that the 
adversary has almost nothing to show forth.


Little did I konw that the acusation is almost ground-less.
**There never was a conflict between science and religion.**

What!? How could I be 



I don't know where I learned this but I thought:



The acient Greeks understood it all, from methematics, ove medicine to politics. But after the church came to power all scientific progress stopped. The "dark ages". Disection was banned, rational thougth if it contradited the bible was censored, and life was miserable and filthy.

Lukily in the Renaissance someone rediscovered the wisdom of the acient Greeks and Romans. Rationality started to bloom, and imediately started the scientific revolution. 
















accusation is almost ground-less. 




I recently read a book entitled "Of popes and unicorns". It's a story about the most sucessfull conspirationtheory.
