<!-- Conspiration theory -->
Fake news and conspiration theories are usually thought of wrong ideas that _other_ people have. 

here I challenge you that there is at least one conspiration that you fall for a wrong idea that even most scientist hold. 




<!-- my story.  -->

As an aspiring scientist and christan believer
I always felt there is a conflict between science and religion.
One side is rational the other delisonate, as Richard Dawkins trumpetes it. 
Naturally, I felt the need to defend my self. 

I read a lot about arguments for the existence of god.
How the Big bang begs the question of a transcendental origin.
How renownd scientist reconsile evolution with the bible. etc. 
I prepared for the battle.


Little did I konw that the 
adversary has almost nothing to show forth.


Little did I konw that the acusation is almost ground-less.
**There never was a conflict between science and religion.**

What!? How could I be 


<!--Wrong ideas spelled out -->
I don't know where I learned this but I thought:

The acient Greeks understood it all, from methematics, ove medicine to politics. But after the church came to power all scientific progress stopped. The "dark ages". Disection was banned, rational thougth if it contradited the bible was censored, and life was miserable and filthy.

Lukily in the Renaissance someone rediscovered the wisdom of the acient Greeks and Romans. Rationality started to bloom, and imediately started the scientific revolution. 



Cosmos, Neil Tyson, 




<!--The book -->

I recently read a book entitled "Of popes and unicorns". It's a story about the most sucessfull conspiration theory.


<!-- How it started -->

Friends organized. 



<!-- The experts  -->

The best way to boast conspiration theories is to ask experts. 
Dawkins, nor Tyson are experts. 


Experts in this case would be the experts in the field of _History of science_. A field that also started around the same time...


Called into existence by a single researcher, 


While the question of the relationship between religion of science is today a quite widely researched question, XXX, did't spent much effort and simply wrote that  ...

To a degree his fault that, the conflict hypothesis, spread so widely. 

As said, the question was and is studied in depths by following scholars and the experts widely agree that the conflict hypothesis is wrong ^[Russel, C.A. (2002). Ferngren, G.B. (ed.). Science & Religion: A Historical Introduction. Johns Hopkins University Press. p. 7. ISBN 0-8018-7038-0. "The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science"]



<!-- Before Christianity the world was not scientific -->


In the book XXX describe multiple cases in which popular (also my) understanding thought that Christianity made things worse and actually the opposite is true. 

Surprisingly, the stories and evidences, the conflict theory is standing are often exaggerated, wrong interpreted, or simply a fiction. 


## The earth is flat

as illustrated in the film Agora,
ancient mathematicians already figured out that the earth is a sphere and 
they were at the verge of understanding that the earth circumvent the sun. But then came christianity, insisted on the docrine of geocentrism and a fixed flat earth.

But here come Copernicus, Galileill, and finally Columbus. 

They challenge the establisehed order by their theoriy, observations. They brave persecution, prison and columbus is even is bold enough to sail in direction of the cliff of the flat earth.

The stuff good storis are made off ... however, not reality. 



Common people might well belived in a flat earth, but 
History of science scholars, long established that during the middle ages, most ...
knew that the earth was a sphere and could even calculate
