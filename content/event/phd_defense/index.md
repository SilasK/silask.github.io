I will soon graduate and defend my PhD thesis entitled "Computational Approaches for a Healthier Microbiome".
I would love you to be part of this event in one way or another.

{{% callout note %}}

Note, there are a public and a private defense. You can attend both.

{{% /callout %}}

I make a public defence on **Friday 3. September**. This way, I will be able to present my work in a funny and accessible manner without the stress of failing to answer properly the questions of the jury.

## Plan:

| Time (CET) |                  |  Place                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 16:30      | I present my PhD work in an accessible  manner.  | L’auditoire Renold      |
| 17:00      | Apéro                                            | Outside, 3d floor       |

The public defence should be streamed with this [Zoom link](https://unige.zoom.us/j/61936446604). If you register I will send it to you by mail.

## Official PhD examination
