Tentative plan:

| Time in CET |                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10:30       | I present my PhD work in a clear and accessible manner.                                                    |
| 11:00       | Torture: I will be questioned in depth by the jury members and maybe yourself.               |
| ~12:00      | Deliberation. The jury deliberates if I should pass my thesis exam or not. At least they pretend to do so. |
| ~12:10      | I get the verdict if I pass or not. I give my acknowledgments. Everybody is happy.  Maybe I will get a PhD hat. |
| ~12:30      | Apéro, outside                                                                                             |




The plan is subject to change due to covid measures.
In theory you should be able to leave or enter the room between the indicated times.
