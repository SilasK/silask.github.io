abstract: Mouse is the most used model for studying the impact of microbiota on its host, but the repertoire of species from the mouse gut microbiome remains largely unknown. Here, we construct a Comprehensive Mouse Gut Metagenome (CMGM) catalog by assembling all currently available mouse gut metagenomes and combining them with published reference and metagenome-assembled genomes. The 50'011 genomes cluster into 1'699 species, of which 78.1% are uncultured, and we discovered 226 new genera, 7 new families, and 1 new order. Rarefaction analysis indicates comprehensive sampling of the species from the mouse gut. CMGM enables an unprecedented coverage of the mouse gut microbiome exceeding 90%. Comparing CMGM to the human gut microbiota shows an overlap 64% at the genus, but only 16% at the species level, demonstrating that human and mouse gut microbiota are largely distinct.
