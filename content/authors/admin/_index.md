I'm fascinated by the microbiome and search for ways to harness it to make us healthier.
When I learned how complicated it was to sequence and the first human genome, I found metagenomics, the idea of sequencing thousand of microbial genomes at once mind-boggling. I'm happy to be part of this endeavor to resolve these enormous puzzles and recover genomes from complicated metagenomes.
I'm finishing my PhD at the University of Geneva in the lab of Prof. Mirko Trajkovski, co-supervised by Prof. Evgeny Zdobnov.
Besides microbiome analysis at the computer, I'm also hands-on involved by changing the diapers of my two children.
