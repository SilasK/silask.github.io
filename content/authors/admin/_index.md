I'm fascinated by the microbiome and search for ways to harness it to make us healthier.

When I first learned about metagenomics, I found the idea of sequencing thousand of microbial genomes at once mind-boggling. I'm happy to be part of this endeavor to resolve these enormous puzzles and recover genomes from metagenomes.
Besides microbiome analysis at the computer, I'm also hands-on involved by changing the diapers of my two children.
