I'm studying the link between alterations in the gut microbiota and the glucose homeostasis in mice using metagenomics and other omics-approaches.
An internship at Nestlé research center allowed me to learn from experts about children gut microbiota and to realize my first publications.
Now, I'm doing a PhD at University of Geneva in the lab of Prof. Mirko Trajkovski and are co-supervised by Prof. Evgeny Zdobnov.
I like to cook with my wife and to dance Salsa, but not both on the same time.
